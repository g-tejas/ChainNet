## Enter On-Chain Analysis
In brief, on-chain analysis involves tracking cryptocurrency transactions. This is possible because, almost every cryptocurrency blockchain is publicly viewable. Meaning you can see money moving between wallets in real time thanks to distributed ledger technology. This is done, using a blockchain explorer (e.g etherscan.io). Chances are, you have done this before when checking whether your transaction went through or not. There's a whole treasure trove of information stored on the blockchain waiting to be analysed, and there's so much more to do than just verifying txn confirmations.

Watching the flow of coins/tokens between the wallets at both the micro and macro levels, can give you a better idea of what the holders of these coins/tokens are doing in real time. In terms of micro-analysis, this involves digging through wallet addresses manually. In terms of macro-analysis, this involves leveraging various paid and unpaid on-chain indicators that don't always involve wallet activity.
